Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management.
This project focuses on Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases to support enhanced poultry health management.
It classifies poultry into four categories: Salmonella, New Castle Disease, Coccidiosis, and Healthy.
The model uses TensorFlow/Keras with a fine-tuned pre-trained CNN for accurate disease detection from poultry images.
A simple Flask-based backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend are used for interaction with users.
This system helps farmers get instant disease diagnosis and suggested treatments, improving poultry farm productivity.
